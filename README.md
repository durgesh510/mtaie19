Problem 4: Chart Image Classification using CNN 

Problem statement: You have to develop a CNN based classification architecture for clas-
sifying a given chart image to one of five chart classes, namely “Line”,“Dot Line”,“Horizontal Bar”,“Vertical Bar”, and “Pie” chart.

Task 0: Learn how CNN is implemented for image classification in PyTorch from the following blog:

PyTorch CNN example

Task 1: Download the dataset from drive link given below.

Use train and val images for training and validation in an appropriate ratio (e.g., 80%
for training and 20 % for validating). The CSV file contains corresponding labels for the
images. TA shall provide dataloader code.
Task 2: Implement a two-layer Convolutional Neural Network. (Hint: use learning from

Task-0), and calculate accuracy, loss and plot the obtained loss. Briefly write your obser-
vation and submit your code so that we can evaluate your implementation at our end.
